           <ul>
               <li class="fragment">This is used when you first create a file. Before you have saved it the first time, your file generally has the name "untitled1" or “Document1”. You must save a file in order to be able to retrieve it again at a later date.</li>
               <li class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">Choosing the Save command once you have already saved a document does not require you to rename the file (you will not see a dialog box).</li>

            <h2>Hacking Passwords</h2>
            <p>There are MANY methods - so keep your passwords safe and long! For now, a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li class="fragment">Write a program that tries every combination of letters and numbers. </li>
                <li class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">Use a “key logger,” wait until you type your password, and then try it (or try every thing you typed WAY faster than you typed it)</li>
                <li class="fragment">Hijack the “autocomplete” feature on your own computer (like tell it to autocomplete when you didn’t) - sometimes it’s stored your password from a less secure site.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Computer Programming: Key Concepts</h2>
            <p class="fragment">One of the most magnificent structures in the computer science world is the function.</p>
            <p class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">Functions (sometimes called procedures) are mini programs that you can use over and over inside of your bigger program.</p>
            <p class="fragment">Functions are pieces of code that you can call over and over again.</p>

                <li class="fragment">Make a plan to solve the problem—use pictures, charts, graphs, systematic lists, objects,or act out the solution to help you devise a plan to solve the problem (In Computer Science, we call this plan an algorithm.)</li>
                <li class="fragment">Carry out the plan—once the plan is conceived and understood, follow the plan. If you have planned well, this is the easy part.</li>
                <li class="fragment">Review and reflect on how the problem was solved—once the problem is solved, reflect on the plan that was used.</li>

            <p>Programming Languages</p>
            <p class="fragment">Whether you know 4 commands of a language or hundreds, you will always be constrained by the programming language.</p> 
            <p class="fragment" style="color:#77A58F">The reason you need to learn how to program is because there isn’t a command to do every little thing; you have to understand the set of things that a programming language can do, and then use your creativity and problem-solving skills to get the computer to do what you want.</p>
